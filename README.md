# Class imbalance learning

In my last project of traffic-collision I learnt that there is a class imbalance in the dataset so in this project I mainly focused in handling imbalance dataset.
In this project I followed couple of steps:
  1. Data Acquisition
  2. Data Preprocessing and Missing value
  3. Train test split
  4. RandomForestClassfier with imbalance classes
  5. RandomForestClassifier with class balancing via RandomUnderSampler
  6. RandomForestClassifier with class balancing via RandomOverSampler

In the conlcusion, I figured out that for this dataset under sampling technique is giving much better result than over sampling as over sampling is over fitting with the dataset.
